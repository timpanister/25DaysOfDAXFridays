// How many employees sold over $100k in 2021?

// METHOD 1: Most elegant solution
Day 24 Curbal Soln = 

CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS (
        FILTER (VALUES(Employees), [Total sales] > 100000)    ---VALUES(Employees) return a filtered Employees table
        ),
    'Calendar'[Year]= 2021 )

// METHOD 2 My Soln: Problem --- If measure is added to a Table or Matrix, the viz cannot be displayed. "SUMMARIZECOLUMNS ...... cannot be used in this context"
// From SQIBI guys. SUMMARIZECOLUMNS does not support evaluation within a context transition. This makes it not useful in most of the measures  
// Solution: SUMMARIZE + ADDCOLUMNS
