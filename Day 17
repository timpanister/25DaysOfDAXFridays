// How many products need to be restocked?
// Units in Stock <= Restock Level , excl Discontinued Products


// Method 1:  Using CALCULATE + FILTER in a row-wise operation
Day 17 Calc Filter = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTA ( Products[ProductID] ),
    FILTER (
        Products,
        Products[UnitsInStock] < Products[Restock level] )
    )

// Method 2: 

//ADDCOLUMNS is much faster than adding a calculated column in the Products Table.  This is because, we only add columns on smaller summarized table.
// Secondly,  consider the efficiency of the order of operation of the inner and outer FILTER arguments :  
// The more efficient one should be executed first, so that the outer filter argument using comparison operator, which by itself slow, operates on a smaller table
// returned by the inner filter.
